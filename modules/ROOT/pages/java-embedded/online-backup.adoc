= Online Backup from Java

In order to programmatically backup your data, full or subsequently incremental, from a JVM-based program you need to write Java code like the following:

[source, java]
----
OnlineBackup backup = OnlineBackup.from( "127.0.0.1" );
backup.backup( backupPath );
assertTrue( "Should be consistent", backup.isConsistent() );
backup.backup( backupPath );
----

For more information, please see the Javadocs for link:{org-neo4j-backup-OnlineBackup}[`org.neo4j.backup.OnlineBackup`^].
